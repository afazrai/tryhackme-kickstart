This repo is to record what I have learned throughout TryHackCIT!


## TryHackCIT
TryHackCIT is a 6 day event from July 27, 2020 to August 1, 2020. Daily.
There are ~3 hour broadcast on https://twitch.tv/tryhackcit where participants are provided a classroom lecture style experience and an interactive session using the TryHackMe platform.

## TryHackMe
TryHackMe is an online platform that teaches cyber security through a mixture of guides and challenges, all through the web browser. Users learn by following tasks and deploying purposefully-built vulnerable machines to practice your hacking skills in a real-world context. TryHackMe's staff and community mentors have worked tirelessly with the University of New Haven to deliver real world examples, lectures, and a hands-on learning experience.

IMHO, TryHackMe is truly beginner friendly, unlike HackTheBox to start learning cyber security.
