# Introduction to the skills of pentesting

## Researching 
When encountering problems that you cannot solve, how are you going to keep going?
It is normal not to know everything, therefore one should have a reliable source of reference for knowledge base.
Google is a very useful search engine in information security.

## Vulnerability searching
Content Management Systems (CMS) like Wordpress, FuelCMS, Ghost are among the popular target. CMSs are meant to ease the process of setting up websites and hackers take the advantage of this convenience to their benefit.

### Out of the box exploits
There are also ready-to-use exploits that can be downloaded. Figuring out the version of the target CMS is an important step in reconnaissance.
These 3 websites are useful if we want to search for the exploits related to a specific software.
- [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)
- [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/)

NVD keeps track of exploits in the following form:
